# Merge Sort

This project contains a JavaScript implementation of the **Merge Sort** algorithm, developed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion) curriculum.

Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm with a time complexity of **O(n log n)**. This implementation recursively splits an array, then merges the sorted halves.

## ðŸ“„ Files

- `merge.js` â€” Contains the full merge sort implementation with:
  - `merge()` â€” Merges two sorted halves of an array.
  - `mergeSort()` â€” Recursively sorts the array.
  - `printArray()` â€” Utility function to print the array.
  - Driver code for testing the sort.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) is installed.
2. Run the file using Node:

```bash
node merge.js
